# triton_fabric_network

The `triton_fabric_network` data source queries Triton for [Fabric Network](https://docs.tritondatacenter.com/public-cloud/network/sdn) information (e.g., subnet CIDR, gateway, state routes, etc.) based on the name of the Fabric Network and ID of the VLAN on which the network has been created.

## Example Usages

## Argument Reference

~> **NOTE:** You can use the [triton_fabric_vlan](/docs/providers/triton/d/triton_fabric_vlan.html) data source to retrieve details about a [Fabric VLAN](https://docs.tritondatacenter.com/public-cloud/network/sdn#vlans) for reference.

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (string) **Required.** The name of the Fabric Network.

* `vlan_id` - (integer) **Required.** The unique identifier (VLAN ID) of the Fabric VLAN.

## Attribute Reference

* `name` - (string) The name of the Fabric Network.

* `public` - (boolean) Whether this Fabric Network is a public or private [RFC1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918) network.

* `fabric` - (boolean) Whether this network is created on a [Fabric](https://docs.tritondatacenter.com/public-cloud/network/sdn). This is always **true** for a Fabric Network.
