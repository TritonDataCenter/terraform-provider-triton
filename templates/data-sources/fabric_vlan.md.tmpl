# triton_fabric_vlan

The `triton_fabric_vlan` data source queries Triton for [Fabric VLAN](https://docs.tritondatacenter.com/public-cloud/network/sdn#vlans) information (e.g., VLAN ID, etc.) based either on the name, VLAN ID or description of the Fabric VLAN.

## Example Usages

{{tffile "examples/data-sources/fabric_vlan/example_1.tf"}}

Find the VLAN ID using name (with a wildcard match) and description of the Fabric VLAN as a search filters:

{{tffile "examples/data-sources/fabric_vlan/example_2.tf"}}

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (string) Optional. The name of the Fabric VLAN.

* `vlan_id` - (integer) Optional. The unique identifier (VLAN ID) of the Fabric VLAN.
